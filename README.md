# Machine-Learning-Algorithms

In this repository I am implementing several standard machine learning algorithms from scratch.  I will be using python to implement these algorithms.  I am intending on using the libraries below, though some will get their own section.

* numpy
* matplotlib
* tensorflow
* pandas

My understanding of these algorithms is coming from the Coursera course on machine learning by Andrew Ng.  I highly recommend this class.
